This repo provides instructions/setup scripts for https://github.com/intel/FPGA-Devcloud/tree/master/main/HandsFree/Simulator/DESim

Provided is also a tcl script that allows running the simulator on Linux. 
Note the TCL script is noticibly slower than the compiled C code so it's recommended to use the c code on Windows 10.
